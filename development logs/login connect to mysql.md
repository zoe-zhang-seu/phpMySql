# Fixing the "Cannot Modify Header Information" Warning

The warning "Cannot modify header information - headers already sent" typically occurs when you try to send HTTP headers (such as `header('Location: ...')`) after output has already been sent to the browser. This can happen if there is any output, including whitespace, before the `header()` function is called.

## Solution

To address this issue, you can use output buffering. This technique allows you to capture output before it is sent to the browser, giving you the ability to modify headers or perform other operations that require headers to be sent first.

### Steps to Fix the Issue

1. **Start Output Buffering:** Use `ob_start()` at the beginning of your script. This will start capturing output.
2. **Call `session_start()`:** Initialize sessions as usual.
3. **Include Dependencies:** Load any required files or libraries.
4. **Perform Operations:** Execute the necessary operations (like handling login).
5. **Flush Output Buffering:** Use `ob_end_flush()` to send the buffered output to the browser.

### Example Source Code

Here is an example of how to use output buffering to fix the warning:

```php
<?php
ob_start();  // Start output buffering
session_start();  // Initialize sessions
require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';  // Load dependencies

use MyProject\Controller\LoginController;

$controller = new LoginController();
$error = $controller->handleLogin();  // Handle login operation

ob_end_flush();  // Flush the output buffer and send output to the browser
?>
```
