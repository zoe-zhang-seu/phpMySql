## note here

 my local not able to work at web server Apache.

 so i set up MAMP, the version could be old, anyway just make it run it is fine.
- web server: nginx 
- php version : 8.2.20
- preference / nginx port : 8081 
- preference / mysql port : 3307
- preference / use mysql server 5.7.44
- preference / General / all checked 

The reason why i use MAMP, is rent a book from library , need to return in August. it suggest to use MAMP. also install mysql, php locally, list a lot of good points to instal database locally. 

## the way to open mysql in MAMP
```bash
/Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysql57/bin/mysql -uroot -p

//password is root
```
- tried vi ~/.bash_file to enable use mysql directly, didn't working.
